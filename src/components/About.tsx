            Hi, my name is Grady. I was born and raised in NYC and am currently
            studying Computer Science at Yale. I'm a student researcher at the{" "}
            <a href="https://vision.cs.yale.edu/">Yale Vision Laboratory</a>,
            where I'm learning about all-weather image removal techniques. As a
            developer, I contribute to{" "}
            <a href="https://yaleclubs.info/">Yale Clubs</a> and{" "}
            <a href="https://yalecomputersociety.org/products/roomadvisor">
              RoomAdvisor
            </a>{" "}
            through the{" "}
            <a href="https://yalecomputersociety.org/">Yale Computer Society</a>
            , and am on the Technology Desk at the{" "}
            <a href="https://yaledailynews.com">Yale Daily News</a>. I also
            helped organize <a href="https://yhack.org/">YHack</a> for both
            Spring and Fall 2024.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love learning and am always excited for new opportunities to
            expand my technical expertise. My current areas of interest are in
            full-stack development, machine learning, and, more recently,
            computer graphics. Some of my favorite animated films include
            Spirited Away, The Good Dinosaur, and WALL-E.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy teaching as much as I do learning! I'm currently a teaching
            assistant for CS 201 (Introduction to Computer Science) at Yale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond computer science, I'm passionate about{" "}
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yalebadminton/"> badminton</a>,
            turtles, fingerstyle guitar, hiking, and food!
