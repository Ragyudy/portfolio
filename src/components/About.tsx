            Hi, I'm Grady, a sophomore at Yale studying Computer Science. I'm a
            student researcher at the{" "}
            <a href="https://vision.cs.yale.edu/">Yale Vision Laboratory</a>,
            where I'm working on all-weather removal. I'm also a developer for{" "}
            <a href="https://yaleclubs.info/">Yale Clubs</a> and RoomAdvisor at
            the{" "}
            <a href="https://yalecomputersociety.org/">Yale Computer Society</a>{" "}
            and an organizer for <a href="https://yhack.org/">YHack</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not programming, you can find me playing badminton with the
            <a href="https://yalebadminton.com"> Yale Badminton Team</a>,
            practicing fingerstyle guitar in my suite, or looking for new food
            spots to try with friends. I'm always excited for new opportunities
            to learn and grow!
