            I love learning and am always excited for new opportunities to
            expand my technical expertise. My current areas of interest are in
            full-stack development, machine learning, and computer graphics.

            I enjoy teaching as much as I do learning! I'm currently a teaching
            assistant for CS 201 (Introduction to Computer Science) at Yale.
